# Machine Learning Kit for Python Beginners
## Overview
The Machine Learning Kit for Python Beginners is a collection of machine learning models and tools designed to help beginners and students from various domains learn how to train, build, and test machine learning models. This kit covers a wide range of tasks, including object detection, image classification, image segmentation, OCR (Optical Character Recognition), face detection, emotion detection, and voice classification. Below is an overview of the key components included in this kit:

* Object Detection
  <br/>
--> YOLO v5: Implement object detection using the YOLOv5 model.
  <br/>
--> Faster RCNN: Perform object detection using the Faster R-CNN model.

* Image Classification
  <br/>
--> CNN Model: Train and classify images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
  <br/>
--> VGG16 Model: Implement image classification using the VGG16 model.

* Image Segmentation<br/>
--> K-means: Perform image segmentation using the K-means clustering algorithm.<br/>
--> Deep Lab: Implement image segmentation using the Deep Lab model.

* Optical Character Recognition (OCR)<br/>
--> Number Recognition: Recognize and extract numbers from images.<br/>
--> Alphabet Recognition: Recognize and extract letters from images.

* Face Analysis<br/>
--> Face Detection: Detect faces in images.<br/>
--> Emotion Detection: Analyze facial expressions and emotions.

* Voice Classification<br/>
--> Voice Classification: Perform audio classification tasks using machine learning.
